## Galaxy Surfer
**A SWapi Project**
## Summary:
- In this project I learned how to "surf" APIs and fetch data through multiple links.
- Have fun navigating through StarWars characters, planets, and vehicles.

### Instructrions:
 - Once the data has loaded, you'll start off on a random episode Crawl
 - From there you can then click in the navigation to switch between the options
 - You can favorite the cards that you like the most.
 
### Installation:
 - Pull down our repo to your local machine
  - If you haven't already, pullup your Terminal
 - Run:  **_npm install_**  to download all of the user/devdependencies
 - Run:  **_npm start_**  to start our webpack server
 - Open:  http://localhost:3000/   or whatever your port number has been changed too (port = 3000).
 - **Enjoy!!**
